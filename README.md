* Users can set their own work and break durations.
* The timer automatically cycles between:
* A Work Session (e.g., 25 minutes)
* A Short Break (e.g., 5 minutes)
* Optional Long Breaks after a certain number of work sessions (maybe after every 2 work sessions?)
* Break time must always be shorter than work time.

### Integrated Task List:
* A built-in task area where users can:
* Add, edit, or remove tasks.
* Check off completed tasks during or after sessions.
* Task list remains visible while the timer is running.
